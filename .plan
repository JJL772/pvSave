- Implement concept of data sources. Being able to save structured data directly from pvxs is nice, but legacy CA support
will probably be necessary for lower spec'd systems (mvme-6100, mvme-3100, etc.). This would require stripping pvxs::Value
from APIs and abstracting that.

- Optimize file parsing and saving. Doing way too many allocations, don't want to fragment heap space too much.
