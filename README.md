# pvSave

**Work in progress!!!**

Modern plugin-based approach to saving/restoring EPICS PVs. Designed as a replacement for autosave, so there are numerous parallels in design.

## TODO List

- [ ] Support array input/output records
- [ ] Automated testing in GitHub CI
- [ ] Get it building with C++11
- [ ] Unit tests for certain components
- [ ] Optimize. Probably rewrite to avoid storing data in intermediate array structures
- [ ] Properly fleshed out HTTP/remote plugin
